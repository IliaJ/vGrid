### `<v-grid>`
----------------------------------

##### Data grid element thats easy to use with multisorting and filtering of a object array for aurelia framework

> Updates

* 30.Mai.2016: new grid source updated, wiki is outdated and can not used atm, demo is updated.
* 29.Mai 2016: new grid soon ready with aurelia toolkit team, do not start new project with this repo. This new build will bring breaking changes, but in a good way, you will defined the markup for headers columns/rows, and aadd attibutes for filter/sorting. This will make it much more flexible. The grid will also get an official plugin under aurelia toolkit.
* 14.Mai 2016: Mostly cleaning up code and debugging atm to make sure its bugfree before making it v 1.0.0
* 23 April 2016: Stared rebuilding to use aurelia attrbutes/viewslots to make it better.
