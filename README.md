* Started working on a new one with grouping and pinned columns 2 weeks ago, source will be held here until more stable/less buggy
* This is very experimental atm and a lot might change/ might not work very well, some parts is very messy
* Not everything will be compatible will the old grid, so old docs is not correct everywhere
* Not made this as a plugin right now, own catalog for sample files and own for plugin under SRC
* For issues /question/suggestions on the experimental grid please keep it under here : https://github.com/vegarringdal/vGrid/issues
* Some commits in the start might have sample and grid changes.. this is more or less to keep code somewhere safe/ make it possible to test/comment code/suggestions
* [temp demo](http://vegarringdal.github.io/vGrid/) not always updated
