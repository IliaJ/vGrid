####[New home under aurelia toolkit](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/aurelia-v-grid)

11 November 2016

* Started working on a new one with grouping and pinned columns
* This is very exprimental atm and a lot might change/ might not work very well
* some places have a lot of repeated code, and might be very messy
* Not everything will be compatable will the old grid.
* Not made this as a plugin atm, and is kinda messy some places, plugin folder under src + aurelia-v-grid.js file is the plugin files, just have it like this because it was simple for me while developing
* For issues /question/suggestions on the exprimental grid please keep it under here : https://github.com/vegarringdal/vGrid/issues
