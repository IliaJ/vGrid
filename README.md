###How to get up and running to test sample ( clone, npm install and jspm install)
* ```git clone https://github.com/vegarringdal/vGrid```
* ```npm install``` on root (cd vgrid after clone)
* ```npm install && jspm install``` under sample (not needed if you are not running sample/gulp watch)

###How to build and run sample
* ```gulp watch``` to run sample, sample refreshes if you make changes to sample or grid code
* ```gulp build``` to build plugin <- you dont need to run this unless you are installing the grid from you private repo after changes

* Started working on a new one with grouping and pinned columns 2 weeks ago, source will be held here until more stable/less buggy
* This is very experimental atm and a lot might change/ might not work very well, some parts is very messy
* Not everything will be compatible will the old grid, so old docs is not correct everywhere
* Not made this as a plugin right now, own catalog for sample files and own for plugin under SRC
* For issues /question/suggestions on the experimental grid please keep it under here : https://github.com/vegarringdal/vGrid/issues
* Some commits in the start might have sample and grid changes.. this is more or less to keep code somewhere safe/ make it possible to test/comment code/suggestions
* [temp demo](https://vegarringdal.github.io/vGridDemo/)
